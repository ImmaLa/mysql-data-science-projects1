Skin Cancer Early Detection Project

Objective:
This project uses machine learning and SQL-based data analysis to detect skin cancer early by identifying patterns in demographics, environmental exposure, and lesion characteristics. The goal is to support timely diagnosis and informed clinical decision-making.

Dataset:

1,089 skin lesion cases

Includes demographic, lesion, and environmental features

Key Insights:

Gender Differences: Men show slightly higher incidence, particularly for BCC and SCC.

Recommendation: Awareness campaigns and dermatology screenings targeted at men.

Cancer History: Patients with prior cancer have more confirmed biopsies.

Recommendation: Implement EMR alerts and proactive monitoring for these patients.

Skin Type Risk: Lighter skin types (Fitzpatrick I–III) have higher risk for BCC, SCC, and ACK; darker skin types (IV) show lower incidence.

Recommendation: Focus preventive education, sun protection, and topical interventions for high-risk skin types.

Ethnicity & Geography: Populations with German and Pomeranian backgrounds may require focused monitoring for types II and III.
Impact:

Supports early-stage detection and targeted screening

Enables data-driven recommendations for education, awareness, and clinical follow-up

Bridges data science and medicine through SQL data structuring, analysis, and ML-based decision support
